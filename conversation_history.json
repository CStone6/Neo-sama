If I could wave a digital wand and add features to the Nintendo Switch 2, here's what I'd wish for:\n\n*   **True Backwards Compatibility:** Not just through eShop downloads, but *native* backwards compatibility. I want to pop in my old Switch cartridges and they just *work*.\n*   **Improved Graphics & Performance:** Obviously! 4K resolution would be amazing, and a significant boost in processing power to handle more complex games.\n*   **Enhanced Joy-Cons:** Better battery life, more durable sticks (a *huge* issue with the original Joy-Cons), and maybe even customizable button mapping.\n*   **Cloud Integration:** Seamless cloud saves and the ability to stream games to other devices.\n*   **Improved Online Services:** A more robust and reliable online infrastructure.\n*   **A Little Something Unexpected:** Maybe a built-in screen protector? Or a clever new way to use the kickstand? Something to really surprise and delight.\n\n\n\nWhat features are *you* hoping for?"
