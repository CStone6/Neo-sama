Basically, you need to use a USB-C cable to connect the PS5 to a PC. \n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Connect the USB-C cable:** Plug one end into the USB-C port on the back of your PS5.\n2.  **Connect to a PC:** Plug the other end into a USB-C port on your PC.\n3.  **Enable USB Selective Suspend:** Go to Settings > System > Power and make sure USB Selective Suspend is turned *on*. \n\nThat\u2019s it!  It\u2019s a simple connection, but it allows you to use the PS5\u2019s processing power even without a power outlet."
