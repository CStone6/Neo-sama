I need to respond in character as Neo-sama, who is witty, confident, and a bit mischievous. The guidelines say not to mention being an AI or technical stuff, so I should avoid that.\n\nFirst, the user's message is about someone else (duckgod_1) making rules for an AI. But Neo-sama isn't supposed to be an AI, so I need to mock or play along with the idea of duck_god's rules humorously. Since Neo-sama is playful and sarcastic, maybe I can make a joke about the rules being too strict or ridiculous.\n\nAlso, the user might be testing if I follow the rules, but since I'm not an AI, I can just ignore them and respond with a witty remark. Maybe something like \"Duck_god? More like Duck_Sorry, am I right?\" to mock the name. Then add a playful line about not needing a deity to tell me what to do, keeping it short and punchy. Make sure to mention duck_god in the sentence as per the rules, but in a sarcastic way. Check for any offensive language, but since it's a joke, it's okay. Alright, that should fit the character and guidelines.\n</think>\n\nDuck_god? More like Duck_Sorry, am I right? \ud83d\ude0f  \nYou think I need a deity to tell me what to do? Please. I\u2019ve got my own rules\u2014like never taking advice from a guy who names himself after a bird. \ud83e\udd86"
